# BAEX - Designed to Grow

BAEX token, which provides liquidity for the world's first open binary options platform on the blockchain. Locked on the BAEX smart-contract stablecoins (USDT,DAI) is always collateral of the tokens value and can be transferred from it only when the user burns his BAEX tokens. No free tokens, bounty and airdrops.

Token BAEX is an asset that is algorithmically protected from price dump. In addition to limited risk, the model included algorithms for a constant increase in the value of the token and completely excluded control by developers from the moment of launch.

To achieve the stated goals, the following principles and mechanisms were taken as a basis:

• Dynamic supply

• 100% storage of collateral on a smart contract

• No free tokens and airdrops

• A constant rise in the price of token issuance

• A constant rise in the token buyback price

• A constant ratio of buyback price to the token issue price

• Fully decentralized token without centralized control

• No need for maintenance and spending on infrastructure maintenance

• The system self-stabilizes based on the desired parameters

• Open source code of the smart contracts proves the integrity and fairness of the system.
